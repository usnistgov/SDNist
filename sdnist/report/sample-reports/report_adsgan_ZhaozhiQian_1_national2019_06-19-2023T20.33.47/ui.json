A score of 0 means two distributions have zero overlap, while a score of 1000 means the two distributions match identically.

The regression line is drawn in red over the heatmap, so you can see the relationship between the target data distribution and its linear regression analysis.

In this approach, we begin by using <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis'>Principle Component Analysis</a> to find a way of representing the target data in a lower dimensional space (in 5 dimensions rather than the full 22 dimensions of the original feature space). Descriptions of these new five dimensions (components) are given in the components table; the components will change depending on which target data set you're using. Five dimensions are better than 22, but we actually want to get down to two dimensions so we can plot the data on simple (x,y) axes the plots below show the data across each possible pair combination of our five components. You can compare how the shapes change between the target data and the deidentified data, and consider what that might mean in light of the component definitions. This is a relatively new visualization metric that was introduced by the <a href='https://pages.nist.gov/HLG-MOS_Synthetic_Data_Test_Drive/submissions.html#ipums_international'>IPUMS International team</a> during the HLG-MOS Synthetic Data Test Drive.",
