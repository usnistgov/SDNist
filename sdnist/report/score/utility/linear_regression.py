        "Linear regression is a fundamental data analysis technique that condenses "
        "a multi-dimensional data distribution  down to a one dimensional (line) representation. "
        "It works by finding the line that sits in the 'middle' of the data, in some sense-- "
        "<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Formulation'>"
        "it minimizes the total distance between the points of the data and the line.</a> "
        "There are more advanced forms of regression, but here we're focusing on the "
        "simplest case-- we fit a simple straight line to the data, getting "
        "the slope and y-intercept value of that line.",

        "For this metric we're just looking at data from adults (AGEP > 15) and "
        "we're only considering the distribution of the data across two features:"
        "<ul>"
        "<li>EDU: The highest education level this individual has attained, ranging "
        "from 1 (elementary school) to 12 (PhD). See Appendix of this report for "
        "the full list of code values.</li>"
        "<li>PINCP_DECILE: The individual's income rank relative to other incomes from "
        "their state, discretized into ten equal-width range bins. "
        "This helps us account for differences in cost of living across the country. "
        "If an individual makes a moderate income but lives in a lower income area, "
        "they may have a high value for PINCP_DECILE indicating that they have a high "
        "income for their state. </li>"
        "</ul>",

        "The basic idea is that higher values of EDU should lead to higher values of "
        "PINCP_DECILE, and this is broadly true. However, it is known that the relationship "
        "between EDU and PINCP_DECILE is different for different demographic subgroups. "
        "The heatmaps in the left column below show the density distribution of the true "
        "data for each subgroup, normalized by education category (so the density values "
        "in each column sum to 1; note that when a cell in the heatmap contains too few "
        "people (< 20 ), it is left blank; its not expected that the deidentified data will "
        "match the original distribution precisely). The regression line is drawn in "
        "red over the heatmap, so you can see the relationship between the target data "
        "distribution and its linear regression analysis. In the right column for each "
        "subgroup we show how the deidentified data's regression line compares to the "
        "target data's regression line, along with a heatmap of the density differences between the two "
        "distributions. Redder areas are where the deidentified data has created too many "
        "people, bluer areas are where it's created too few people.",

        "We've broken this metric down into demographic subgroups so we can see not only how "
        "well the privacy techniques preserve the overall relationship between these features, "
        "but also whether they preserve how that overall relationship is built up from the "
        "different relationships that hold at each major demographic subgroup. "
        "It's important that deidentification techniques preserve these distinct "
        "subgroup patterns for analysis."
